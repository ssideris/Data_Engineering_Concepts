## Data & Operations

DataOps, short for Data Operations, is a transformative approach that bridges the gap between data engineering, data science, and IT operations. It aims to enhance collaboration, streamline workflows, and automate processes, all in the pursuit of making data more accessible, reliable, and agile.

A suggested structure of studying the tutorials:
