    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, how would you define an analytics engineer? Analytics engineers focus on the transformation of raw data into transformed data that is ready for analysis. This new role on the data team changes the responsibilities of data engineers and data analysts. In other words, Analytics Engineers work as an intermediate that bridges data engineers and data analysts as they understand both of the underlying infrastructure of data and the business/analytics needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](Images/Picture9.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are going to use dbt (data build tool), a transformative framework that has revolutionized the way we engineer analytics. dbt empowers data teams to leverage software engineering principles for transforming data by using SQL modules to model and transform data so that they are available in the correct format for use by the data analysts. dbt is playing a crucial role in the transformation part of the ELT (extract-load-transform) methodology, collecting data from modern Data Platforms and transforming them based on the needs of the analytics teams. Some of dbt's characteristics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modularization and Reusability: DBT allows you to modularize your SQL code into reusable \"models\". This makes it easier to maintain and scale your data transformations as your data and business needs evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Version Control: DBT projects can be version-controlled using Git, which means you can track changes to your data transformations over time, collaborate with team members, and roll back to previous versions if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Testing: DBT provides a framework for writing and running data tests to ensure the quality and consistency of your data. You can create tests to validate data integrity, conformity to business rules, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Documentation: DBT encourages the documentation of data models and transformations. This helps team members understand the data pipeline and how different data elements are derived and used.\n",

    "For detailed documentation on dbt refer [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction)."

    "### How does dbt work\n",
    "\n",
    "In the modern data era, organizations use cloud-based Data Platforms to store their data after extraction, avoiding the pre-transformation step and performing custom transformations afterwards based on analytics needs. This way, data pipelines are becoming more efficient and cost-effective. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this architecture, dbt's role is to sit on top of the Data Platforms and help on the transformation step. dbt is able to connect to the Data Platform of our choice, detect the databases and schemas stored inside of it, develop models that transform data into new tables and views and store them inside the Data Warehouse, test and version control the developments and finally deploy jobs that automate the data supply to the analytics teams and bring them to production.

The ref function is helping to modularize our scripts avoiding repeating the same code and making the code more managable and reusable for other developments. As we do not configure the result of the code, a model view is automatically created. The difference of view from table is that a view is just a virtual table that does not store data itself but represents an SQL code snippet that calls and displays a substract of data from a table or another view  while a table is a physical database object that stores data in a structured format.
