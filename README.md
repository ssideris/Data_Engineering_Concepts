# Data_Engineering_Concepts
This Repository is a personal attempt to persuade a variety of Data Engineering concepts and create dynamic and maintanable Data Management pipelines. My scope is to gain a deeper understanding on how different Data Management infrastructures affect organizations in day-to-day activities and to offer step-by-step guidance on recreating them.

Many of the included infrastructures were inspired by the DataTalksClub / data-engineering-zoomcamp.

The Repository will be updated regularly with newly suggested Data Management Infrastructures and Tools.
