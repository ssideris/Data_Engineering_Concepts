# Data Management and Analytics Operations

This repository represents my personal endeavor to explore various data management and analytics operations and establish flexible and sustainable data management and analytics pipelines. My objective is to enhance my comprehension of how diverse data management and analytics infrastructures impact organizations in their daily operations and provide clear, step-by-step instructions for replicating them using industry best practices.

I will continually update this repository with fresh recommendations for data management and analytics infrastructures and tools. Many of the files are interconnected and can be integrated into a unified infrastructure.

Many of the included infrastructures were inspired by the [DataTalksClub / data-engineering-zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) and [DataTalksClub / mlops-zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp).
